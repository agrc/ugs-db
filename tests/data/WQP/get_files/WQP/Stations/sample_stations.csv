Air and water temperature are manually recorded weekly when water samples are collected.,17040212,152,ha,,,42.5291498136,-114.294501945,,,,,NAD83,,,,,,,US,16,83,,,,,,,,
ARS,USDA Agricultural Research Service,ARS-IDUSR-IDUSRTN,IDUSRTN,,"IDUSRTN is an irrigation return flow monitoring station on T and N Coulees located on private property within the Twin Falls Irrigation Tract, which is managed by the Twin Falls Canal Company (TFCC), in the Upper Snake Rock watershed. These coulees are tributaries to the Snake River and receive seasonal irrigation return flow and continous subsurface drain flow. The ARS manually measures stream flow over two 2 ft TFCC structures with a weir stick, manually collects a water quality sample, and records the water and air temperatures weekly all year.  The actual drainage area may vary due to the area encompassing the irrigation supply and irrigation return flow paths that may not correspond with the DEM.",17040212,1073,ha,,,42.6665804187,-114.822576666,,,,,NAD83,,,,,,,US,16,83,,,,,,,,
